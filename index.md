# Super Paqi Currencies

Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are cryptographic tokens that represents an unique digital asset. NFTs are in contrast to Fungible Tokens which are cryptographic tokens that have equal value to that same token. One example of an NFT is a digital piece of art in which there is only one copy of. Conversely, an example of a fungible token is Bitcoin in which each Bitcoin is of equal value to each other. Super Paqi Currencies is an NFT art project that derives unique value using Ethereum's ERC-721 blockchain technology.

Super Paqi Currencies is an 8-bit series of avatars that embody one of the top twenty cryptocurrencies, by market-cap, at the time the NFT is minted. The first release of the Super Paqi Currencies series consist of "Uniswap Paqi", "Bitcoin Paqi", "Etheruem Paqi", and "Chainlink Paqi". The second release of Super Paqi Currencies consist of "Bitcoin Cash Paqi", "Ripple Paqi", "Cardano Paqi", and "Ethereum Classic Paqi". These NFTs can be purchased on the [Opensea](https://opensea.io/collection/super-paqi-currencies), an NFT trading platform.

## Artist Statement

Ethereum and Bitcoin are the behemoths of the crypto space. However, every bull run various altcoins get their time in the limelight with 10x price pumps and sometimes more! During these bull markets, and even during bear markets, the top cryptocurrencies in coin market cap can change drastically. An example of this can be seen with XRP which plummeted below top 20 in coin market cap after the SEC crackdown, but for various reasons pumped back up to be in the top ten cryptocurrencies by market cap within the next couple of months. Super Paqi Currencies attemps to pay homage to this volatile history of cryptocurrencies. With each series of releases, Super Paqi Currencies will release four NFTs that represent four of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap. The goal is that over time, despite the fallout or boom of cryptocurrencies, an artistic, NFT history can be kept of the cryptocurrencies that once had (or still may have) market dominance.

Not only is Super Paqi Currencies an artistic digital record of popular cryptocurrencies, it's also an exploration to the question "What is value?". For fungible tokens like ETH, ATOM, or 1INCH, it is commonly understood that as more people adopt the token, the token's value will go up. However, when it comes to art, the valuation of such pieces aren't so linear. Depending on aesthetic, complexitiy, or even meme-worthiness, pieces of digital art can vastly differ in value despite similar design. The valuation of art can be rather subjective at times, and this subjectivity is in direct contrast with any fungible currency out there be it United States Dollar or Bitcoin. Super Paqi Currencies plays on this direct contrast by creating art out of currencies based on their market cap values. This project hopes to get people to reflect on how they percieve value. Will they peg their valuation based on the currency it represents or will the 8bit avatars themselves take over the valuation dominance. Furthermore, how will time impact such valuations. Super Paqi Currencies is a serialized project that personifies fungible cryptocurrencies in order to get people to ponder with questions of value and time.

## About Paqi Aysia

I am primarily an 8-bit style NFT artist who enjoys making characters that embody objects or symbols. Creating 8-bit avatars is my way of personifying objects I interact with in day to day life. For me, art is an outlet to turn things I see and experience into my own little virtual reality space. My goal is to bring my NFT's to virtual platforms like Decentraland and create an array of cute, enjoyable avatars that can give people the sentimental feelings associated with the lovable objects they may have interacted with in the past. 

I started my journey into the blockchain space first as an Ethereum miner and then began to explore the development and NFT side of the Ethereum blockchain. As I learn more and more about the crypto space, I fall further in love with it. I hope that in learning about Ethereum development and creating a unique style of NFT art, I can leave a lasting impact on a community that never fails to bring people together.
