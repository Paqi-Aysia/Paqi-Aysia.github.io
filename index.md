# Super Paqi Currencies

Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are cryptographic tokens that represents a unique asset. NFTs are in contrast to Fungible Tokens which are cryptographic tokens that have equal value to that same token. One example of an NFT is a digital piece of art in which there is only one copy of. Conversely, an example of a fungible token is bitcoin in which each bitcoin is of equal value to each other. Super Paqi Currencies is an NFT art project that derives unique value using ethereum's ERC-721 blockchain technology.

Super Paqi Currencies is an 8-bit series of avatars that embody one of the top twenty cryptocurrencies, by market-cap, at the time the NFT is minted. The first release of the Super Paqi Currencies series consist of "Uniswap Paqi", "Bitcoin Paqi", "Etheruem Paqi", and "Chainlink Paqi". These NFTs can be purchased on the [Opensea](https://opensea.io/), an NFT trading platform.

## Artist Statement

Ethereum and Bitcoin are the behemoths of the crypto space. However, every bull run various altcoins get their time in the limelight with 10x price pumps and sometimes more! During these bull markets, and even during bear markets, the top cryptocurrencies in coin market cap can change drastically. An example of this can be seen with XRP which plummeted below top 20 in coin market cap after the SEC crackdown, but for various reseasons pumped back up to be in the top ten cryptocurrencies by market cap within the couple months. Super Paqi Currencies attemps to pay homage to this volatile history of cryptocurrencies. With each series of releases, Super Paqi Currencies release four NFTs that represent four of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap. The goal is that over time, despite the fallout or boom of cryptocurrencies, an artistic, NFT history can be kept of the cryptocurrencies that once had (or still may have) market dominance.

Not only is Super Paqi Currencies an artistic digital record of popular cryptocurrencies, it's also an exploration to the question "What is value?".
